| September 24th |  8:50 - 9:25  |         Tyler and I worked on the whiteboards to try to figure out a way to search through the dictionary with binary search. We figured out a way that would likely work and be pretty fast, but it would definitely not be linear time so we're going to rethink it and try again. Maybe some sort of arrayList of arrayLists would work for O(1) lookups but that would get bloated very fast. |

| September 26th | 11:35 - 12:00 | I figured it out!! I used a LinkedHashSet which is the perfect data structure for this (I knew something like it existed because of unreal engine but I had to look it up to find what the java equivalent is). It allowed me to quickly add words to the misspelled words list only if they aren't already in the misspelled words, since sets only allow for one copy of each value in the set. |
