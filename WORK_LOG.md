We figured out a way that would likely work and be pretty fast, but it would definitely not be linear time so we're going to rethink it and try again. Maybe some sort of arrayList of arrayLists would work for O(1) lookups but that would get bloated very fast. |

I used a LinkedHashSet which is the perfect data structure for this (I knew something like it existed because of unreal engine but I had to look it up to find what the java equivalent is). It allowed me to quickly add words to the misspelled words list only if they aren't already in the misspelled words, since sets only allow for one copy of each value in the set. |
| October 1st    | 11:45 - 11:55 am, 8:00 - 8:40 pm | In the morning I began rewriting all my code to use TST. I accidentally messed up a commit though so that work just got scrapped. At night, I redid my work and added a TSTNode class, where I have instance variables for isWord, the three possible connecting nodes, and the char that it represents. I am very confused on how to implement the actual TST algorithm however, I tried starting it and I might have a foundation for it but I have no idea how to get the current node? Hopefully I can go to tutorial tomorrow or something and figure it out because I am very confused. |

I started by making a recursive insert method. I'm not sure if I got it working though because it is kind of difficult to tell, but at least I fixed the compile errors. It is oddly slow though which is concerning, I must have done something wrong somewhere so I will need to fix that. Next I'm going to try to do the contains method in the TST class, might have to do this recursively as well? |

I'm not totally sure why it doesn't work though because it seems like it should. I'll hopefully figure it out tonight. |
