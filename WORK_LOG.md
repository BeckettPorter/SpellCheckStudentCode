| September 24th | 8:50 - 9:25 |                                                                                                               Tyler and I worked on the whiteboards to try to figure out a way to search through the dictionary with binary search. We figured out a way that would likely work and be pretty fast, but it would definitely not be linear time so we're going to rethink it and try again. Maybe some sort of arrayList of arrayLists would work for O(1) lookups but that would get bloated very fast. |
| September 25th | 2:00 - 3:00 | I made an algorithm which uses a map and does correctly return the misspelled words, it is just a bit slow for some tests. I realize that using a map in the way I have is completely pointless, as I don't ever use the value. Update: I changed it to use a boolean and set it to true if I have already found that misspelled word. I don't totally know what it does right now it isn't working but I ran out of time so I am typing this up quickly. I'll try to fix it tonight or tomorrow night. |
