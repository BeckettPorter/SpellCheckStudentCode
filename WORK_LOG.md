We figured out a way that would likely work and be pretty fast, but it would definitely not be linear time so we're going to rethink it and try again. Maybe some sort of arrayList of arrayLists would work for O(1) lookups but that would get bloated very fast. |

I used a LinkedHashSet which is the perfect data structure for this (I knew something like it existed because of unreal engine but I had to look it up to find what the java equivalent is). It allowed me to quickly add words to the misspelled words list only if they aren't already in the misspelled words, since sets only allow for one copy of each value in the set. |

I accidentally messed up a commit though so that work just got scrapped. At night, I redid my work and added a TSTNode class, where I have instance variables for isWord, the three possible connecting nodes, and the char that it represents. I am very confused on how to implement the actual TST algorithm however, I tried starting it and I might have a foundation for it but I have no idea how to get the current node? Hopefully I can go to tutorial tomorrow or something and figure it out because I am very confused. |

I started by making a recursive insert method. I'm not sure if I got it working though because it is kind of difficult to tell, but at least I fixed the compile errors. It is oddly slow though which is concerning, I must have done something wrong somewhere so I will need to fix that. Next I'm going to try to do the contains method in the TST class, might have to do this recursively as well? |

I'm not totally sure why it doesn't work though because it seems like it should. I'll hopefully figure it out tonight. |

I managed to reduce the number of incorrect words returned, but it is still too many. I am not sure what is wrong with my code, I've gone through it many times and it seems like it should work, I might be misunderstanding TSTs? I also still need to implement Tries which is unfortunate because I still haven't even gotten TSTs to work... |

I subtracted 'A' from the char so it should be from 0-25? Hopefully I can figure it out tomorrow. |
| October 6th    |          3:00 - 4:05 pm          | I worked more on my Trie class, for one, I realized that I'll need an array of the size of all the possible characters that could appear in a word, which is a lot bigger than just 26 because it has things like apostrophes. I managed to get it SUPER close but for some reason my contains method is missing a few words randomly and I actually cannot figure it out for the life of me. Like I have been banging my head against the wall for an hour trying to figure out why it isn't working, I have tried every single loop boundary, checking my insert method, checking to make sure my misspelled words list is working correctly, and none of it has fixed it. I did find an issue with my misspelled words list not behaving right, so I turned it into a LinkedHashList and now it works. However, I still can't figure out why my contains method isn't working. I might have to take a late on this project as I literally cannot figure this out for the life of me, might be redoing all my code for the third time in the near future :/ |
